Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Waste Classification Data by Sashaank Sekar. It contains a total of 25,077 labeled images, divided into two categories: Organic and Recyclable. This dataset is designed to facilitate waste classification tasks using machine learning techniques.

Key Details:
Total Images: 25,077
Training Data: 22,564 images (85%)
Test Data: 2,513 images (15%)
Classes: Organic and Recyclable
Purpose: To aid in automating waste management and reducing the environmental impact of improper waste disposal.
Approach:
Studied waste management strategies and white papers.
Analyzed the composition of household waste.
Segregated waste into two categories (Organic and Recyclable).
Leveraged IoT and machine learning to automate waste classification.
